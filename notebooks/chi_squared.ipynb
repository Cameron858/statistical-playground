    "## Test of Independence\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-squared Test of Independence is used to determine whether there's a statistically significant association between two categorical variables. It assesses if the occurrence of one variable affects the probability of the other variable occurring, or if the distribution of one variable is independent of the distribution of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test is typically applied when you have observed frequencies of two categorical variables from a single population, organised into a contingency table (cross-tabulation). It helps identify if any observed differences in frequencies arise from chance, or if there are underlying reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this test, the null hypothesis (H0) states that the two variables are independent (i.e., there's no association between them). The alternative hypothesis (H1) states that the two variables are dependent, implying a significant association exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will test if the *biological sex (M/F)* of an individual affects heart disease. We can formulate the above as such:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses**\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Let\\ X\\ = biological\\ sex,\\ Y = heart\\ failure $ \n",
